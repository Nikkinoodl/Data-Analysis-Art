# Data-Analysis-Art
This data analysis of my portrait and art business uses my own data, collected over a period od 21 years to draw some insights and show what challenges lie in the workings of a studio.
Wherever possible, the data has been anonymized and some financial data has been normalized.

The analysis is done in four stages, starting with some EDA and visualization and ending with some complex polynomial regression. For a readable summary of the results, please refer to my blog at https://portraitsbysimonbland.com/blog
