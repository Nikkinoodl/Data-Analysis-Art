# Data-Analysis-Art
This data analysis of my portrait and art business was done as a demonstration and an exercise. It uses my own data, collected over a period of 21 years to draw some insights into the business and show what challenges await in the fine art business.
Wherever possible, the data has been anonymized and all financial data has been normalized. It doesn't make any difference to the value of the analysis and privacy is important.
